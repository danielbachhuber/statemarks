Helping open source project maintainers to answer "is this still maintained?"

> If you’re like the average open source developer, you’ve probably published some code on Github that you haven’t touched in years. Because the code has some users, then the project probably has a backlog of a couple dozen issues you’ll never get to. Some are bugs, some are feature requests; all require more attention than you have for them.
> 
> If you’re like the average open source developer who accidentally created a popular project, you’ve probably felt completely overwhelmed by users’ demands for support, bug fixes, and new features. Already have a full time job? Congratulations, now you have two jobs, but one of them doesn’t pay, doesn’t offer benefits or vacation, and you can’t quit.
